# About me
Hello, I'm currently a computer science student at SPU with a passion for solving problems through code. I got into programming because I enjoyed the idea of using creativity to build things from scratch and bring them to life with logic. While I struggled at first, over time it started to click, and I began to enjoy the process of learning, solving challenges, and seeing real progress as I created new projects.

I usually try to code in the evenings as I have more time during those hours, which is perfect for working through these complex challenges. Whether it's classwork or personal projects, I try to always stay consistent with my learning, as this is a skill that grows with practice and patience. My main experience is C++, but I want to learn new languages to expand my skill set and become a more versatile coder over time.
